						" when deciding which foods are regularly stocked in the house. Kids won't go hungry. They'll eat what's available in " +
						"the cupboard and fridge at home. If their favorite snack isn't all that nutritious, you can still buy it once in a while so they don't feel deprived." +
						"    From the foods you offer, kids get to choose what they will eat or whether to eat at all. Kids need to have some say in the matter. Schedule regular" +
						" meal and snack times. From the selections you offer, let them choose what to eat " +
						"and how much of it they want. This may seem like a little too much freedom. But if you follow step 1," +
						" your kids will be choosing only from the foods you buy and serve.    Quit the clean-plate club." +
						" Let kids stop eating when they feel they've had enough. Lots of parents grew up under the clean-plate rule," +

You may need to serve a new food on several different occasions for a child to accept it. Don't force a child to eat, but offer a few bites. With older kids, ask them to try one bite." +
				"Rewrite the kids' menu. Who says kids only want to eat hot dogs, pizza, burgers, and macaroni and cheese? When eating out, let your kids try new foods and they might surprise you with their willingness to experiment. You can start by letting them try a little of whatever you ordered or ordering an appetizer for them to try." +
